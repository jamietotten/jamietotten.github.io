            <p>How uneasy it is to write a bio about yourself? But here I am, giving it a try!</p>
            <p>At the age of 5, I was given my first drum kit and had a tape of The Who as my only teacher. This was the beginning of a lifelong love story with music. (Thanks Mom and Dad)</p>
            <p>In my early years as a drummer, I have been fortunate to experience touring with bands and recording albums in various studios such as Electrical Audio, The Hive, and The Bathouse. Those shared experiences allowed me, as a self-taught musician, to develop my knowledge in songwriting which for my future solo career turned out to be rather useful!</p>
            <p>It would take lots of pages to write about my influences, so let's talk about the essentials: Thee Oh Sees, Led Zeppelin, as well as the hypnotic rhythms of Fela Kuti, or the drivin' North Mississippi sound and swagger of R.L. Burnside. The thump of 90’s hip hop and the warm tones of old dub also resonates loudly. More recently, I’ve been inspired by the album ‘Splendour of Fear’ by Felt, and the abstract stamp that Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah has put on jazz.</p>
            <p>Speak Low is a huge blend of all those influences, mixed with transformational periods of my life spread over two years. The first five tunes were intended as an ep, recorded in London, Ontario with my good friend Eric Conway at Bloodwood Studios. Those songs sat on the shelf for months, incomplete. Awaiting a spark, the support from the one I love, linked with the process of reflection during far off travels and the more recent confinement of a global pandemic inspired me to complete this record. Also the sheer realization of the costs involved to press vinyl as an independent artist gave me the kick in the ass to write more songs to maximize my investment!</p>
            <p>So, with the help of Julian Marrs at Marrs Audio here in Victoria, BC, we reworked old ideas and experimented with new ones to craft the remaining songs.  This process was completed during three-hour long sessions each week for almost a year. The result, a 13-song album that symbolizes a couple of years of my life.</p>
            <p>I’m very grateful to have had wonderful people to collaborate with to bring this record to life. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
